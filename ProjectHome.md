Ewige Hoffnung is 2D-RPG with an extensive storyline and a realistic gameplay.
It is currently under active development and written in Ruby, using [Gosu](http://libgosu.org/) as the game engine.
Despite the German title, there is a translation module to switch languages. For now, only German and English will be supported. If you're interested in translating the game into other languages, feel free to contact me.

I'll abandon this project once again. I will use the source code to create an other game, see the [SourceForge.net page](https://sourceforge.net/p/essytas/home/).

After over half a year of nothing, I'm back! :)

Completely rewrote the characters and started the third engine last monday.
Development is going really fast, I expect the engine to be finished in a few weeks already.
Replanning of the storyline is a bit slower, so the actual game will probably take a few months.
I'll start some commits in the next days also, so you can take a sneak preview of what I've done so far. :)
